##This program is an attempt to solve the following puzzle.

### Description
Take a sentence, strip the spaces, unify the case, cut the sentence up into segments that are of either length 2 or 3, finally shuffle these segments

The puzzle is thus to attempt to rearange these segments, such that they form the original sentence.


### Example:

['ILL', 'ES', 'SHU', 'MPL', 'CEW', 'IS', 'EN', 'FF', 'EXA', 'TEN', 'LED', 'TH', 'BE']

(this process is completed by the python program shuffle.py)
